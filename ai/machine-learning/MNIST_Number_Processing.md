# MNIST Number Processing

ChatGPT Answers

## Why does Mnist have 784 digits for training?

The MNIST dataset doesn't have 784 digits for training. Rather, it has 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The 784 you're referring to is the number of pixels in each image.

MNIST images are grayscale and have a size of 28x28 pixels. When these images are flattened into a one-dimensional array, there are 28 * 28 = 784 values representing the grayscale intensity of each pixel.

These 784 values are used as features to train machine learning models, such as neural networks, to recognize the digits. The reason behind using a 28x28 pixel format is that it provides a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and the ability to represent the necessary details to distinguish between different digits.
