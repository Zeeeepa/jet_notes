### 1. GPUs are now also extensively used for performing parallel computations

Although GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) were initially designed for handling graphics processing, they are now also extensively used for performing parallel computations in many scientific and engineering applications, including deep learning.

### 2. GPUs can train large deep learning models much faster than CPUs

Deep learning models are typically large neural networks that require extensive computations, which can be accelerated using GPUs.

GPUs can handle thousands of computations in parallel, which enables them to train large deep learning models much faster than CPUs (Central Processing Units).

### 3. The computations involved in training neural networks are highly parallelizable

The reason why GPUs are particularly suitable for deep learning is that the computations involved in training neural networks are highly parallelizable. 

This means that many calculations can be performed simultaneously on different data points, and GPUs are optimized for this kind of computation. By contrast, CPUs are designed for more sequential processing, which makes them less efficient for deep learning workloads.

### 4. GPUs can handle thousands of computations in parallel, making them ideal for training large neural networks

In summary, GPUs are well-suited for deep learning because they can perform thousands of parallel computations simultaneously, making them ideal for training large neural networks.
