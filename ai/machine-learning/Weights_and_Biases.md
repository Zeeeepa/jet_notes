# Weights and Biases

ChatGPT Answers

## General

Weights and biases are both important parameters in a neural network that affect the behavior of the network and its ability to make accurate predictions.

## Weights

Weights are the parameters that connect the neurons in adjacent layers of a neural network. Each connection between two neurons has a weight associated with it, which determines the strength of the connection. The weights are learned during the training process and are used to transform the input data into a form that can be more easily interpreted by the network. By adjusting the weights, the network can learn to recognize patterns in the input data and make accurate predictions.

## Biases

Biases, on the other hand, are parameters that are added to the outputs of each neuron in a layer before being passed on to the next layer. Biases provide the network with a way to shift the activation function to the left or right, which can be useful for modeling complex relationships between input and output variables. Biases are also learned during the training process and are used to fine-tune the network's output.

## Are weights and biases always calculated manually?

No, the weights and biases of a neural network are typically learned automatically during the training process using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent. During training, the neural network takes in input data and generates output predictions, and the difference between the predicted output and the actual output (i.e., the error or loss) is used to update the weights and biases. This process is called backpropagation, and it uses the chain rule of calculus to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight and bias in the network. The gradient is then used to adjust the weights and biases in a way that minimizes the loss over the training data.

In short, the weights and biases are not calculated manually, but rather learned automatically through the optimization algorithm during the training process.

## Summary

In summary, weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons, while biases provide an additional parameter that can shift the activation function of each neuron in a layer. Both weights and biases are learned during the training process and are critical for the performance of a neural network.
