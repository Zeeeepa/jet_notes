I apologize, as TensorFlow is a Python library and it does not have official support for JavaScript. However, you can use TensorFlow.js, which is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser. Here is an example of a simple neural network implemented in JavaScript using the TensorFlow.js library that generates code in the React JavaScript library:

```
  const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');

  // Define the model architecture
  const model = tf.sequential();
  model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 256, inputShape: [1000], activation: 'relu' }));
  model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 512, activation: 'relu' }));
  model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1024, activation: 'relu' }));
  model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 2048, activation: 'relu' }));
  model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 4096, activation: 'softmax' }));

  // Compile the model
  model.compile({ optimizer: 'adam', loss: 'categoricalCrossentropy', metrics: ['accuracy'] });

  // Train the model
  const xs = tf.tensor2d(x_train);
  const ys = tf.tensor2d(y_train);
  await model.fit(xs, ys, { epochs: 10, batchSize: 32 });

  // Generate code
  const generatedCode = model.predict(tf.tensor2d(x_test));
```

As I mentioned before, this is just an example, it's not a complete and working solution. Keep in mind that you need to prepare input dataset , train it and test it to see the results.
Also, this example is using a simple Neural Network architecture, and it may not be suitable for code generation task specifically. There are other models such as transformer based models like GPT-3, GPT-2 and BERT that are specifically designed for the natural language processing tasks.
