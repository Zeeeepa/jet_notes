1. Image Classification: A neural network can be trained to recognize objects in images by being fed a dataset of labeled images. The network learns to identify patterns in the images and can then classify new images based on those patterns.

2. Natural Language Processing: A neural network can be used to process and understand human language. This can be used in tasks such as language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.

3. Predictive Maintenance: A neural network can be trained on sensor data from industrial equipment to predict when maintenance will be needed. This can help companies schedule maintenance more efficiently and reduce downtime.

4. Self-driving Cars: Neural networks are used for perception, decision-making and control in autonomous vehicles. They can be trained on vast amounts of data to detect objects, track their motion, anticipate their behavior and make decisions accordingly.

5. Recommender Systems: Neural networks can be used to recommend products or content to users based on their past behavior and preferences. This can be used in online marketplaces, streaming services, and social media platforms.
