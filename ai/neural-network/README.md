## Tips

### Basics
 * A neural network is a series of nodes, or neurons. Within each node is a set of inputs, weight, and a bias value.
 * Each hidden neuron has a single condition.
 * These certain conditions which differ neuron to neuron are called "Threshold".



## Terms
- Inputs
  * Inputs are the set of values for which we need to predict a output value. They can be viewed as features or attributes in a dataset.

- Weights
  * Weights are the real values that are attached with each input/feature and they convey the importance of that corresponding feature in predicting the final output.

- Bias
  * Bias in a neural network is required to shift the activation function across the plane either towards the left or the right. We will cover it in more detail later.

- Summation function
  * It is defined as the function which sums up the product of the weight and the features with bias.

- Activation function
  * It is required to add non-linearity to the neural network model.
