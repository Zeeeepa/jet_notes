@Pieter Here are some questions:
1. Given the example in the video, what if the user is typing "Main St." which is an abbreviation, should we catch this as a possible duplicate?
2. Is the duplicate check applicable to contact specific fields only?
3. What if for ex. out of 3 fields in a rule, 1 field has an empty value, does the duplicate validation still trigger? 
4. Can a field exist in multiple rules?
5. Should we apply duplicate checks to Text Area and Checkbox field types? If not, which field types should we only allow duplicate checks?
6. Does sections / sub-sections matter? Or fields can be restricted regardless if they are on different sections / sub-sections?
